### Live Version
You can access the live version at [vvamp.github.io/TicTacToe](https://vvamp.github.io/TicTacToe)

## Usage
### Controls
You can control the game using the left mouse button

### Gamemodes
There are currently 2 gamemodes: "2 Player Mode" and "Battle Against AI".  
2-Player mode allows 2 local players to take turns using the same mouse to play their turn.  
In battle against AI, you take it up against a(very stupid) AI.   
I might make a smarter AI in the future.
